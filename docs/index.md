# KG-Hub Downloader

| [Documentation](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/kghub-downloader) |

### Overview

This is a configuration based file caching downloader with initial support for http requests & queries against elasticsearch.

### Installation

KGHub Downloader is available to install via pip:
```
pip install kghub-downloader
```

### Configure 

#### Download Configuration

The downloader requires a YAML file which contains a list of target URLs to download, and local names to save those downloads.
The format for the file is:
```yaml
---
- 
  url: "http://example.com/myawesomefile.tsv"
  local_name: myawesomefile.tsv
-
  url: "http://example.com/myokfile.json"
  local_name: myokfile.json

```

You can also include any secrets like API keys you have set as environment variables using `{VARIABLE_NAME}`, for example:  
```yaml
---
-
  url: "https://example.com/myfancyfile.json?key={YOUR_SECRET}"
  localname: myfancyfile.json
```
Note: You _MUST_ have this secret set as an environment variable, and be sure to include the {curly braces}
